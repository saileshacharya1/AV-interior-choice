## 📄 **Highlights**

This study investigates how **vehicle automation** and **in-vehicle environments** influence mode preferences and the **value of travel time (VOTT)**. A stated choice experiment was conducted among **696 visitors to U.S. national parks**, comparing preferences across:

- **Human-driven vehicles (HV)**
- **Autonomous vehicles (AV)**
- **Autonomous vehicles with work/leisure-friendly interiors (AV-WL)**

### 🔑 Key Findings:

- **VOTT estimates**:  
  - HV – **$34.80/hr**  
  - AV – **$31.10/hr**  
  - AV-WL – **$29.90/hr**

- AV-WL interiors **enhance the benefit** of in-vehicle entertainment activities
- AV adoption may **increase demand for larger, more comfortable vehicles**
- **In-vehicle productivity and leisure potential** are critical for understanding the mobility impacts of AVs
